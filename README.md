 Hotel Recommendation System


Abstract :
                 Online hotel searching is a formidable task due to the wealth of online information. A hotel recommender system based on sales records includes the user's preference relations among hotels. Basic premise under the research is that the selling records include the user's preference relations among hotels. The proposed system recommends hotels based on preferences of users when a user selects a hotel. In order to recommend the hotels this identifies the user’s preference transition and makes recommendation based on them. Based on user preference the system recommends hotel when a user selects a hotel. The main function of recommender system predicts user’s preference from the rating information, filters some items from massive information, and suggests candidate items for user. The system makes recommendation to a user based on a hotel which a user selects on the system.
                 
Introduction :
                       Today’s people are getting dependent more on web technologies like internet. Many user-centered platforms are now available for information sharing and user interaction, such as Epinion, Amazon, Facebook and Twitter. But here comes a typical question for a trip: if we plan to visit the Forbidden City in Beijing for several days, where should we live? Selecting a suitable hotel can be vital for a pleasant trip. However, the past hotel check-in data of an individual may be sparse due to low rating frequency, which means the performance of rating based collaboration filtering technique is poor. The sparsity issue and the so-called cold start problem are the main challenges for hotel recommendation. CF method is combined with CBF method to overcome sparsity issue. collaborative filtering  or content based filtering cbf.CF focuses on finding similar users based on user-item rating matrix, the precision of which has proven to be good but sensitive to sparse data. When recommender system encounters a new user, background knowledge may be insufficient. It is hard to decide whether specific hotel match his/her preference or not. One possible solution is to employ diversity techniques, to satisfy one’s preference as broad as possible, so that monotony of the recommendation result is avoided.

Project Implementation Technology 
 The Project is loaded in Sublime Text 10. We used Sublime Text 10 for  Design and coding of project. Created and maintained all databases into SQL  Server 2008, in that we create tables, write query for store data or record of  project. I used technologies Html,Css,javascript

❖ Hardware Requirement: 
⮚ i3 Processor Based Computer or higher 
⮚ Memory: 1 GB RAM 
⮚ Hard Drive: 50 GB 
⮚ Monitor 
⮚ Internet Connection 

❖ Software Requirement:

Advantages & Limitations 
Cost savings 
Because the whole process is online, logistics are simplified and streamlined. 

Time saving 
For applicants and government authorities alike, time and money are wasted on  clumsy and frustrating paper-based systems. 
∙ The system has feasibility for the applicant to apply and submit the visa  application through online. 
∙ It is an automated system; the applicant can apply for the visa at any time  from any place. 

Limitations 
∙ May provide incorrect results if data entered incorrectly. 
∙ Requires an active internet connection.

conclusion :
Our aim was to use innovative technological tools, as a way to boost tourism sector. The idea of “Hotel Recommendation by user preferences” will help user to change their way of search hotel by there own requirements or preferences. Further work involves the implementation of this system throughout the Pune city, and the testing of its efficiency with tourists interested in this region. Therefore, the criteria to success would be the degree of general satisfaction of visitors during their trip.
